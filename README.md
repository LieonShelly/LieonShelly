About Me

I am Renjun Li, a Senior Software Consultant at ThoughtWorks, with 9 years of professional experience in iOS application development. My expertise spans Swift and Objective-C, with a strong background in large-scale iOS development, architecture design, performance optimization, and cross-functional team collaboration.

In the Porsche App project, I served as the iOS Lead, managing the Home Charging team and driving critical technical decisions. I collaborated closely with the German development team to ensure the successful delivery of high-quality features. In the SC Mobile project, I led the core iOS feature development team, where I worked on multi-factor authentication, notification systems, and configuration management, while also optimizing the build process to enhance performance and user experience. In addition, I contributed to the Chinese translation of iOS Development at Scale, further deepening my understanding of best practices for enterprise-level iOS development.

Beyond enterprise solutions, I also have experience in C++ image rendering and audio/video processing. I previously led the development of photo and video editing applications at Camera360, several of which were featured on the App Store and attracted hundreds of thousands of users.

I am proficient in CI/CD automation tools such as Fastlane, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins, and I specialize in Clean Architecture, TDD, and modular development. I am also experienced with agile methodologies and OKR-driven team management.

My professional focus is on improving both technical quality and team efficiency, while consistently delivering robust and scalable iOS solutions for global clients.
