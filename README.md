Hi, I’m Renjun Li. I have 9 years of experience in iOS app development and currently work as a Senior Software Consultant at ThoughtWorks. My main focus is managing and developing iOS projects for international clients. I’m skilled in Swift and Objective-C and have deep experience in large-scale iOS development, architecture design, performance optimization, and team collaboration.

In the **Porsche App** project, I worked as the **iOS Lead**, managing the home charging team and making key technical decisions. I collaborated closely with the German team to ensure high-quality delivery. In the **SC Mobile** project, I led core app iOS team feature development, including **MFA authentication, notification systems, and configuration management**. I also optimized the build process to improve performance and user experience. Besides that, I contributed to the **translation of the book "iOS Development at Scale,"** where I studied best practices for large-scale iOS development.

Beyond enterprise projects, I also have experience in **C++ image rendering and audio/video processing**. I previously led the development of **photo editing and video editing apps** under **Camera360**, which were featured on the App Store and gained hundreds of thousands of users.

I’m also familiar with **CI/CD automation tools** like **Fastlane, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins**. I specialize in **Clean Architecture, TDD, and modular development** and have experience with **agile methodologies and OKR management**. 

So, improving both technical quality and team efficiency is something I always strive for.
